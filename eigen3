# Download latest version at https://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/downloads/

# How to remove previous version
sudo rm -r -f path/eigen3
ex: sudo rm -r -f /usr/include/eigen3

# How to install
1. Download source 
2. mkdir build
3. cd build/
4. cmake source_dir
source_dir: where source downloaded is.
ex: cmake ~/Desktop/eigen-eigen-f900795d858f
5. sudo make install
To check cmake, open the file generated CMakeCache.txt in the folder build/.
ex: To build eigen3 for ROS kinetic, we need eigen3 installed into usr/include, so CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX should be "usr/" and
INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR should be "include/eigen3"
